Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.
## Project description
This is an implementation of the well-known Hangman game where the computer thinks of a word from a list and the user tries to guess it. 
The aim of the project is to demonstrate my ability to code using basic Python.
## File structure of the project
There is **ReadMe** file with general information about the project, and **Milestone_5.py** file which you can download to play the game.
## Installation requirements 
Standard Python installation
## License information
No license needed to download the game. 

## What I learnt at every stage of the project
### Milestone 1:
- setting up GitHub environment
- understanding how distributed versions control systems such as Github work
### Milestone 2:
- creating the list and choosing a random item from the lsit
- asking for and validating user input
### Milestone 3:
- checking input for validity and relevance by creating distinct functions
- testing functions
### Milestone 4:
- creating OOP class and initialising the attributes
- defining methods to validate user input and check if user guessed the letter correctly
### Milestone 5:
- creating a function to run the game
- coding the logic of the game
- optimising the code
- testing the code and dealing with any issues by refining the code
